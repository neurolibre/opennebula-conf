# opennebula-conf

opennebula-conf is a temporary repo that holds the installation scripts for the opennebula cluster.
When the opennebula terraform scripts will be ready, the content of this repository will be integrated with terraform-binderhub and this repository will be destroyed.
So spawning an opennebula cluster will be also available in the terraform context script.

All secure informations has been removed.
